# Getting started

The Structurizr CLI provides tooling to parse [Structurizr DSL](https://github.com/structurizr/dsl) workspace definitions, upload them to the Structurizr cloud service/on-premises installation, and [export diagrams to other formats](export.md) (e.g. PlantUML, Mermaid, and WebSequenceDiagrams).

## 1. Download and install the Structurizr CLI

There are a number of ways to download/install the Structurizr CLI.

### Docker, dev containers, etc

A prebuilt Docker image is available at Docker Hub. To use it, for example:

```
docker pull structurizr/cli:latest
docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/usr/local/structurizr structurizr/cli <parameters>
```

In this example, `$PWD` will mount the current local directory as the CLI working directory (`/usr/local/structurizr` in the Docker container).

Alternative containers are available via:

- [leopoldodonnell/structurizr-cli-docker](https://github.com/leopoldodonnell/structurizr-cli-docker)
- [aidmax/structurizr-cli-docker](https://github.com/aidmax/structurizr-cli-docker)
- [evilpilaf/structurizr-remotecontainer](https://github.com/evilpilaf/structurizr-remotecontainer)

### Local installation

Download the Structurizr CLI from [https://static.structurizr.com/download/structurizr-cli.zip](https://static.structurizr.com/download/structurizr-cli.zip), and unzip. You will need Java (version 11+) installed, and available to use from your command line (__please note that the CLI does not work with Java versions 11.0.0-11.0.3__).

### Homebrew (MacOS only)

The Structurizr CLI can be installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) as follows:

```
brew install structurizr-cli
```

And to upgrade:

```
brew update
brew upgrade structurizr-cli
```

### Scoop (Windows only)

The Structurizr CLI can be installed via [Scoop](https://scoop.sh) as follows:

```
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install structurizr-cli
```

And to upgrade:

```
scoop update structurizr-cli
```

### Build from source

To build from the source, clone this repo and run the following command:

```
gradlew build
```

## 2. Create a software architecture model with the DSL

Create a new empty file with your favourite text editor, and copy the following text into it.

```
workspace "Getting Started" "This is a model of my software system." {

    model {
        user = person "User" "A user of my software system."
        softwareSystem = softwareSystem "Software System" "My software system."

        user -> softwareSystem "Uses"
    }

    views {
        systemContext softwareSystem "SystemContext" "An example of a System Context diagram." {
            include *
            autoLayout
        }

        styles {
            element "Software System" {
                background #1168bd
                color #ffffff
            }
            element "Person" {
                shape person
                background #08427b
                color #ffffff
            }
        }
    }
    
}
```

Save this file into the current directorry directory as `workspace.dsl`.

This DSL definition:

- creates a person named "User"
- creates a software system named "Software System"
- creates a relationship between the person and the software system
- create a System Context view for the software system
- creates some element styles that will be applied when rendering the diagram

Please note that the Structurizr CLI will create some default views for you if you don't define them yourself in the DSL. See [Defaults](defaults.md) for more details.

## 3. Render with Structurizr, or export to other diagram formats

You can now either render your diagrams with the Structurizr cloud service/on-premises installation, or render your diagrams with another tool (e.g. PlantUML, Mermaid, etc).

### Upload and render with the Structurizr cloud service/on-premises installation

If you've not done so, follow [Structurizr - Getting started](https://structurizr.com/help/getting-started) to sign up for a free Structurizr account, and create a workspace. To upload your workspace to the Structurizr cloud service/on-premises installation, you will need your workspace ID, API key and secret. See [Structurizr - Workspaces](https://structurizr.com/help/workspaces) for information about finding these.

Open a terminal, and issue the following command to upload the workspace (ensure you have it on your path):

```
./structurizr.sh push -id WORKSPACE_ID -key KEY -secret SECRET -workspace WORKSPACE_FILE
```

or

```
structurizr push -id WORKSPACE_ID -key KEY -secret SECRET -workspace WORKSPACE_FILE
```

- WORKSPACE_ID: your workspace ID
- API_KEY: your API key
- API_SECRET: your API secret
- WORKSPACE_FILE: the name of your workspace DSL file

You can now sign in to your Structurizr account, and open the workspace from [your dashboard](https://structurizr.com/dashboard). Your workspace should now contain a diagram like this:

### Export and render to other diagram formats

Alternatively, you can export the views defined in your DSL workspace definition to a number of other formats, for rendering with other tools. You do not need a Structurizr account to do this. For example, to export the views to PlantUML format:

```
./structurizr.sh export -workspace WORKSPACE_FILE -format plantuml
```

or

```
structurizr export -workspace WORKSPACE_FILE -format plantuml
```

This will create one PlantUML definition per view. See [export](export.md) for more details.
